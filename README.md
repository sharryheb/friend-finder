# FriendFinder

This application is essentially a friend matching service. 

It is hosted here: https://friend-finder-sdh.herokuapp.com/

## Setup
1. Clone this repo to your local directory.

2. Navigate to your repo in your command terminal, and enter:

Feel free to load your own starter data into the friends.js file, or use the ones already in there.

## Overview
The home page of the app has a button to start the survey.

The survey will present you with a questionnaire.

Clicking submit will generate your match and display it to you in a modal window.
